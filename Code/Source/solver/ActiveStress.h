 *
 * ## Overview {#activestress-overview}
 *
 * This class provides an interface for defining active stress models, i.e.
 * models that, in the context of structural mechanics of muscular tissue,
 * compute an active tension representing the contribution of muscular
 * contraction to the constitiutive law.
 *
 * The class assumes that the active tension can be expressed as
 * @f[
 *   \Tact = \Tact(t, \calcium, \fiberstretch, \fiberstretchrate,
 *                 \astressstate),
 * @f]
 * where @f$\calcium@f$ is the intracellular calcium concentration,
 * @f$\fiberstretch@f$ is the fiber stretch, @f$\fiberstretchrate@f$ is the
 * fiber stretch rate, and @f$\astressstate@f$ is a vector of internal state
 * variables, representing the state of contraction.
 *
 * The expression assumed above implies that the active tension is a local
 * function of the variables it depends on, that is the active tension at a
 * given point only depends on the value of other variables at that same point.
 * Accordingly, this class works nodally, by evaluating the active tension at
 * every mesh node and storing it in a vector, whose values can be accessed
 * through @ref ActiveStress::get_tension_fibers.
 *
 * ## Directional distribution of active stress {#activestress-directions}
 *
 * In muscular mechanics models, active stress normally acts only along the
 * direction of fibers @f$\fiberdirection@f$, reflecting the fact that
 * contractile units are aligned with fibers. However, one might want to account
 * for fiber dispersion, i.e. the fact that fibers are not perfectly and
 * regularly aligned, but rather have a certain distribution of orientations
 * centered around the principal direction @f$\fiberdirection@f$.
 *
 * This can be surrogated by defining the active stress tensor as
 * @f[
 *   S_\text{act} = \Tact \left(
 *     \eta_f \fiberdirection \otimes \fiberdirection +
 *     \eta_s \sheetdirection \otimes \sheetdirection +
 *     \eta_n \sheetnormaldirection \otimes \sheetnormaldirection
 *   \right),
 * @f]
 * where @f$\sheetdirection@f$ and @f$\sheetnormaldirection@f$ are the sheet and
 * sheet-normal directions, respectively, and @f$\eta_f@f$, @f$\eta_s@f$, and
 * @f$\eta_n@f$ are coefficients that define the distribution the active tension
 * along the three principal directions. The coefficients must be such that
 * @f$\eta_f + \eta_s + \eta_n = 1@f$.
 *
 * This class stores the values of @f$\eta_f@f$, @f$\eta_s@f$ and @f$\eta_n@f$,
 * and provides the functions @ref ActiveStress::get_tension_fibers,
 * @ref ActiveStress::get_tension_sheets and @ref
 * ActiveStress::get_tension_sheet_normals to access @f$\eta_f \Tact@f$,
 * @f$\eta_s \Tact@f$ and @f$\eta_n \Tact@f$, respectively.
 *
 * ## Implementing concrete active stress models {#activestress-implementing}
 *
 * To implement a new active stress model, the following steps need to be taken:
 *
 * 1. Create a new class derived from @ref ActiveStress.
 * 2. Override the methods @ref init_local, @ref advance_time_step_local and
 *    @ref compute_active_tension_local, defining the initial condition,
 *    time evolution and active tension computation, respectively, for a single
 *    node.
 * 3. Create a new class derived from @ref ActiveStressModelParameters to store
 *    the parameters specific to the new active stress model.
 * 4. Override the methods @ref get_parameters,
 *    @ref read_model_specific_parameters and
 *    @ref distribute_model_specific_parameters to manage the parameters of the
 *    new active stress model.
 * 5. Register the new class into the active stress model factory by using the
 *    macro @ref REGISTER_ACTIVE_STRESS_MODEL. The macro should be called in a
 *    `.cpp` file, not in a header file.
 *
 * Notice that if the model is expressed in terms of a system of ODEs, it can
 * be implemented by deriving from @ref ActiveStressODE, which already addresses
 * some of the points above.
 *
 * ## Coupling with the structural mechanics problem {#activestress-coupling}
 *
 * The active tension depends on the fiber stretch @f$\fiberstretch@f$ both
 * directly, through the expression of @f$\Tact@f$, and indirectly, through the
 * state @f$\astressstate@f$, which is itself driven by the fiber stretch. The
 * mechanics problem, in turn, depends on @f$\Tact@f$.
 *
 * Explicit time discretization for the direct dependence was observed to lead
 * to instabilities. Accordingly, the direct dependence is discretized
 * implicitly, that is the active tension is recomputed within the nonlinear
 * iterations for the structure problem that uses ActiveStress. To facilitate
 * the convergence of nonlinear iterations, this class also allows to compute
 * the derivative @f$\frac{\partial\Tact}{\partial\fiberstretch}@f$, which is
 * used to assemble tangent terms associated to this in the structural system.
 *
 * Indirect dependence was not observed to give rise to instabilities.
 * Accordingly, it is discretized explicitly by default, meaning that the state
 * is updated once per time step evaluating the fiber stretch
 * @f$\fiberstretch@f$ using the displacement from the previous time step. The
 * user can change this behavior by setting the parameter @c
 * Implicit_state_coupling to @c true in the XML file. This will make the state
 * update every nonlinear iteration. No tangent terms are computed for this
 * contribution, so nonlinear iterations can be expected to converge more slowly
 * when this is enabled.

  /**
   * @brief Evaluates the active tension of an element at its quadrature
   * points.
   *
   * An active stress model holds its state at the mesh nodes, because that is
   * where the fiber stretch driving its ODE is available. The mechanics
   * problem, however, needs the active tension at the quadrature points of an
   * element.
   *
   * This class bridges the two. @ref update copies the nodal state of an
   * element once, and @ref evaluate interpolates it to a quadrature point and
   * evaluates the active tension there, against the fiber stretch of the
   * deformation gradient being assembled.
   *
   * Evaluating the tension at the quadrature point, rather than at the nodes,
   * makes its dependence on the fiber stretch local to the element: the
   * stretch comes from the deformation gradient of that quadrature point
   * alone, and not from the L2 projection of the stretch onto the mesh nodes,
   * which averages over a patch of elements.
   *
   * The state is the one the active stress model was last advanced to, and it
   * is held fixed by this class: only the direct dependence of the active
   * tension on the fiber stretch is resolved here, while its indirect
   * dependence, through the state, is resolved by the nonlinear iterations of
   * the mechanics problem.
   *
   * This class is a friend of @ref ActiveStress, so that @ref update can copy
   * the state directly out of @ref ActiveStress::states rather than through an
   * accessor.
